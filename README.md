# IoT-Based Smart Street Lighting and Energy Management System

This repository contains the files and resources for an **IoT-based Smart Street Lighting and Energy Management System**, designed to optimize energy consumption, enhance public safety, and support the sustainability goals of urban infrastructure.

## Project Overview

The **Smart Street Lighting System** integrates real-time sensor data and automation to manage public street lighting efficiently. This system dynamically adjusts lighting intensity based on environmental conditions and human or vehicular activity. The **Energy Management System** ensures optimal power usage by leveraging renewable energy sources like solar panels while also utilizing backup energy storage when needed.

### Key Features
- **Energy Efficiency**: Automated lighting control that reduces energy waste, saving up to 60-80% of energy consumption.
- **Public Safety**: Motion sensors detect pedestrians and vehicles to automatically increase lighting when necessary.
- **IoT Integration**: A variety of sensors gather environmental and activity data for efficient lighting and energy management.
- **Renewable Energy**: Solar panels provide a renewable power source, with energy backup systems to maintain functionality during low sunlight periods.
- **Remote Monitoring**: The system can be controlled and monitored remotely via a centralized control interface.

## Sensors Used
- **Light Sensor**: Detects ambient light to turn street lights on/off based on natural lighting.
- **Motion Sensor**: Detects movement from pedestrians or vehicles, adjusting lighting as needed.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Measures environmental temperature to monitor system component performance.
- **Weather Sensor**: Monitors weather conditions (e.g., rainfall, humidity) to adjust lighting intensity based on visibility needs.
- **Current & Voltage Sensor**: Tracks energy consumption and detects anomalies in the power supply.
- **Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor**: Detects heat signatures from nearby humans or animals.

## System Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: The system gathers real-time data from various sensors, including motion, light, and weather conditions.
2. **Lighting Automation**: Street lights adjust brightness based on sensor data. For example, they increase brightness when movement is detected and dim when no activity is present.
3. **Energy Management**: The system automatically switches between solar energy and battery storage to optimize power consumption.
4. **Remote Control**: The system can be monitored and adjusted through a central control system using IoT connectivity.

## Tools & Technologies
- **CupCarbon**: A smart city and IoT simulator used to design, simulate, and analyze the smart street lighting system.
- **IoT Sensors**: Deployed in various parts of the system to gather real-time data for automation and optimization.
